# CSC120-FinalProject

## Deliverables:
 - Your final codebase
 - Your revised annotated architecture diagram
 - Design justification (including a brief discussion of at least one alternative you considered)
 - A map of your game's layout (if applicable)
 - `cheatsheet.md`
 - Completed `rubric.md`
  
## Additional Reflection Questions
 - What was your **overall approach** to tackling this project?
 we focused on having simple methods and then we built on them to have the loop and to allow multiple paths in the game. We also focused on the storyline as we wanted it to be intertaining and engaging. We also worked on having a strong base for our game for example having the different battles with different conditions. 
 - What **new thing(s)** did you learn / figure out in completing this project?
 We learned that we have to plan before starting to code. We learned how to use while loops for our advantages by switching different variables between true and false.
 - Is there anything that you wish you had **implemented differently**?
 YES!
 We wanted to use a map to enhance the storyline in the game.
 We wanted to add audio in the battles and make them more complex and intertaining.
 we wanted to have more options when the player chooses to explore.
 we wanted to have cats with more special attributes.
 we wanted to have an inventory so the player can interact with game more.
 - If you had **unlimited time**, what additional features would you implement?
 we would implement what we mentioned before and we would have used graphics. We had the code for the map almost ready but because of the time limit we couldn't finish it and had to delete it.
 - What was the most helpful **piece of feedback** you received while working on your project? Who gave it to you?
 we are not sure who was the person, but they adviced us to mention what makes each cat special. Altough it might sound like a simple thing but actually it is very helpful in explainig the game and the point of it
 - If you could go back in time and give your past self some **advice** about this project, what hints would you give?
 To meet up more with the team to work on the game.
 plan first!!!
 focus on the details because they might cause an unexpected error at the same time don't ignore the big image
 - _If you worked with a team:_ please comment on how your **team dynamics** influenced your experience working on this project.
 We had very different scheduales and we were bad at managing to meet up. We did not do well with deviding the work and it was hard to balance working on the code all of us together. Since the map idea didn't work the project noe seems very simple so we think that if we work on it more in the future it will be very fun and more engaging and we plan on doing that.
