# CSC120-FinalProject

## Deliverables:
 - Your final codebase (`Store.java`, `menuItem.java`, `Menu.java`, `Inventory.java`, `handleInput.java`, `gameController.java`)
 - Your revised annotated architecture diagram (`architecture diagram.png`)
 - Design justification (including a brief discussion of at least one alternative you considered) (`design justification.md`)
 - A map of your game's layout (if applicable) (text included in `cheatsheet.md`)
 - `cheatsheet.md`
 - Completed `rubric.md`
  
## Additional Reflection Questions
 - What was your **overall approach** to tackling this project?

My approach to this project begins from making draft for classes structure along with its attributes and methods for the game. Then, I systematically implement each part of this deaft. I also revised my plan based on feasibility and user experience.

 - What **new thing(s)** did you learn / figure out in completing this project?

I learned the use for scanner class since it is frequently called in my code. I also figure out how to draw up the plan and build a game from start to end.

 - Is there anything that you wish you had **implemented differently**?

I wish I could organize classes in a different structure and avoid taking scanner as an input argument in methods.

 - If you had **unlimited time**, what additional features would you implement?

I will add techinique, equipments and cleaniness to the store. Each of them has different way to improve and higher the value is, higher the income the player will get.

 - What was the most helpful **piece of feedback** you received while working on your project? Who gave it to you?

My boyfriend has some experience in java and he is the first player of my game. He suggested me to get rid of the parts that I was not able to handle, and helped me design the game values and make sure they are balancedã€‚

 - If you could go back in time and give your past self some **advice** about this project, what hints would you give?

I will tell myself "Don't be too stressful!" I was so worried that I wouldn't be able to finish the project that I sacrificed some of the fun and interactivity of the game.

 - _If you worked with a team:_ please comment on how your **team dynamics** influenced your experience working on this project.

I work alone.
